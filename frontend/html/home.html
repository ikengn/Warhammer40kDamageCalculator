            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">Warhammer is a tabletop battle game which puts players in command of armies of valiant humans, noble elves, savage orcs or a variety of twisted and monstrous creatures. 
                <br>Players collect forces of miniature plastic models, all with different stats and abilities, and use them to play out clashes on a tabletop battlefield. 
                Unlike a board game, <br>where players’ moves are restricted to defined areas, 
                Warhammer commanders freely manoeuvre <br>their units set distances 
                using rulers and resolve shooting and hand-to-hand combat by rolling dice.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">The purpose of this service is to be able to particpate in simulations to see how your units would perform<br>
            You can select both friendly and enemy units to conduct a simulation as well as provide manual dice rolls or allow for randomization
            <br>Additionally our service provides the ability to view previous damage calculations through the usage of our history page</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">On the next page you will be able to select said units above as well as their desired weapons. Upon doing so you will continue through <br>
            the stages of the typical battle phase in which you will see if you <b>hit your target</b> then next if you will <b>wound your target</b> <br>
            and finally you will then see how much <b>damage</b> is inflicted upon your enemy. With each step of the way indicating a new dice roll that can be randomized <br>
            or it can be manually set by you, the user.</p>
